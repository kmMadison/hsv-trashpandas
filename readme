Steps to Set Up Python/Flask

1) Ensure you have the latest version of Python installed

2) Make a new folder - i.e. space_hsv

3) Open Visual Code (Not Studio) and open the folder space_hsv

4) Install the python virtual machine with the command: 
	- pip3 install pipenv (This is the windows command.)

5) Enter the command: 
	- pipenv shell
	- This will create a pip file that will keep track of all the packages once installs

6) Once you launch the virtual environment, you need to install some dependencies as follows in the command line:
	- pipenv install -U Flask-SQLAlchemy
	- pipenv install psycopg2
	- pipenv install psycopg2-binary (might not be needed. run without first. only download if necessary)
	- pipenv install flask flask-sqlalchemy flask-marshmallow marshmallow-sqlalchemy
		- https://flask-marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
	- pipenv install gunicorn (for deployment to heroku)
	
7) To Launch localhost - cd into the folder flaskr and run the command:
	- python __init__.py
